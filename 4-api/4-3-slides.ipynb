    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Artifical Intelligence has become more accessible thanks to REST API's. It is not possible to run most of these models on your local machine due to the computational power required. Companies like Open AI, Anthropic, and Perplexity have made it possible to access their models through Web API's. This has opened up a new world of possibilities for developers to build applications that can understand and generate human-like text, create art / music, and solve puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course will use Open AI's API to demonstrate some of these capabilities. \n",

    "- Text generation is the process of generating text using a model that has been trained on a large corpus of text. We provide the model a **text prompt** consisting of a question, insructions, examples, or both. The model then generates a response based on the prompt."

      "Computers use binary because it aligns well with their electronic nature. Here are a few reasons why binary is the ideal choice:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Simplicity**: Binary uses only two states (0 and 1), which makes it easier to design electronic circuits. Each state can correspond to an off (0) or on (1) condition in a circuit, minimizing complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Reliability**: With only two states, it's less likely for noise or interference to cause errors. In a binary system, it's easier to distinguish between the two states, reducing the chances of misinterpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Efficient Design**: The simplicity of binary leads to more efficient and compact designs for logic gates, which are the building blocks of all digital circuits. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Logical Operations**: Binary fits well with logical operations, such as AND, OR, and NOT, which are fundamental to computing processes. These operations can be easily implemented using binary digits.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Error Detection and Correction**: Binary systems allow for effective error detection and correction techniques, enhancing data integrity during processing and storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, binary is a natural fit for the physical and logical requirements of computer systems.\n"

      "HIPPIE : Far out, man! Think of your car as a groovy dance floor. When you're moving and grooving, sometimes it can be tough to keep your moves smooth and effortless, especially when trying to spin and turn. That’s where power steering comes in, like a trusty friend giving you a gentle push to help you keep your rhythm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you're at a wild dance party, and you want to make a sharp turn. Without that friend, you might struggle, feeling all the weight of the world (or the car) on your shoulders. But with power steering, it’s like having a buddy who’s got your back, helping you glide effortlessly into that turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s how it works, man: when you turn the steering wheel, it sends a message to a pump, which is like a DJ spinning the tunes to keep the vibe alive. This pump uses hydraulic fluid—think of it as the magic potion that makes everything flow smoothly. It works to amplify your effort, so even if you’re just lightly nudging the wheel, the car responds with a smooth, slick turn, just like a well-choreographed dance move. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, power steering is all about making your ride easier and more enjoyable, letting you groove without the heavy lifting. Peace and love, my friend! 🌼✌️\n",

      "\n",
      "In hydraulic systems, when ye turn the steering wheel, it opens a valve that allows pressurized fluid to flow into a cylinder, pushing a piston that helps turn the wheels. In electric systems, sensors detect the steering input and an electric motor provides the necessary assist.\n",

      "So, while it ain’t quite the thrill of raising the Jolly Roger or plundering gold, it surely helps ye navigate through the treacherous waters of city streets without breaking a sweat! Now, back to tales of treasure and the high seas! Arrr! 🏴‍☠️\n",
      "ROBOT : Power steering uses hydraulic or electric actuators to assist the driver in turning the steering wheel. Hydraulic systems use fluid pressure, while electric systems use an electric motor. Beep boop.\n"
