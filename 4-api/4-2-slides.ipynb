    "\n",
    "When you are making a lot of requests to an API, it is a good idea to cache the results. We don't want to make the same request over and over again if we don't have to as this can effect our rate limits and thus our pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caching can be done in a number of ways. The simplest method is a Python dictionary where the key is the request and the value is the response. You can use Python `pickle` library to save the dictionary to disk so that you can use it across multiple sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The caching strategy looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Check if the request is in the cache\n",
    "    2. If it is, we have a CACHE hit:\n",
    "    3.    return the response from the ca\n",
    "    4. else (cache miss)\n",
    "    5. Call the API to get the response\n",
